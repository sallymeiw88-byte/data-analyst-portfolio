👋 Hi, I’m Sally Mei

I’m a Junior Data Analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, Python (Pandas), and Google Sheets.
I focus on cleaning, structuring, and analyzing data to produce clear, actionable insights for business decision-making.

I’m currently completing a professional Data Analyst bootcamp, where I work with real-world datasets to solve business problems and communicate data-driven findings.
